# ðŸ¤– AI Integration Setup for Makena Pro

## Overview
Makena Pro now includes AI-powered responses using OpenAI's GPT models to provide more intelligent and contextual assistance to customers.

## Features Added

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Responses
- **Intelligent Question Handling**: Complex queries, shopping advice, and open-ended questions
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Remembers conversation history for better responses
- **Personality Preservation**: AI maintains Makena's friendly, playful personality
- **Visual Indicators**: AI responses are marked with brain icons and "AI Powered" labels

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart AI Triggers
The AI is automatically triggered for:
- Questions starting with "how", "why", "what if"
- Shopping-related queries ("recommend", "suggest", "advice")
- Gift-giving questions ("help me choose a gift")
- Complex or open-ended questions
- Messages longer than 15 characters

### ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced UI
- **AI Status Indicator**: Shows when AI is enabled in the header
- **AI Response Styling**: Special gradient background for AI responses
- **Loading States**: "AI thinking..." indicator during processing
- **Quick Actions**: AI-powered quick action buttons

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Add Environment Variable
Create or update your `.env` file in the `e-commerce` directory:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration Options

You can customize the AI behavior by modifying these settings in `ServiceChatbot.tsx`:

```typescript
const [aiConfig, setAiConfig] = useState<AIConfig>({
  enabled: false,
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",        // AI model to use
  temperature: 0.7,              // Creativity level (0-1)
  maxTokens: 150                 // Maximum response length
});
```

## Usage Examples

### AI-Powered Questions:
- "How do I choose the right gaming laptop?"
- "What's the best gift for a tech enthusiast?"
- "Can you recommend something for my home office?"
- "What's the difference between these two products?"
- "Help me decide between these options"

### Rule-Based Questions (No AI):
- "Show me gaming products"
- "Cancel my order"
- "Add to cart"
- "Check order status"

## Cost Considerations

- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens (very affordable)
- **Typical response**: 50-100 tokens (~$0.0001-0.0002 per response)
- **Estimated cost**: Less than $1 for 1000 conversations

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Working?
1. Check if API key is set correctly
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure API key has sufficient credits

### Performance Issues?
1. Reduce `maxTokens` for shorter responses
2. Lower `temperature` for more focused responses
3. Check API rate limits

## Security Notes

- API key is stored in environment variables (not in code)
- API key is only used client-side for AI responses
- No sensitive data is sent to OpenAI
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add conversation memory for better context
- [ ] Implement product-specific AI training
- [ ] Add sentiment analysis for better responses
- [ ] Create AI-powered product recommendations
- [ ] Add multilingual support

**Note**: The AI integration gracefully falls back to rule-based responses if the API is unavailable or disabled, ensuring Makena Pro always works!
