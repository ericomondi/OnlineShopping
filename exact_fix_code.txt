Flowtechs was founded by two young, enthusiastic developers, **Eric Omondi** and **Steve Leo**, who are passionate about joining and shaping the tech revolution in Kenya and beyond.

**Background:**
Eric and Steve met as university students, both driven by a love for technology and a desire to solve real-world problems. They noticed that many Kenyans, especially in rural areas, struggled to access quality products at fair prices. Inspired by the global e-commerce boom, they decided to build a platform that would make premium shopping accessible to everyone in Kenya.

**Their Vision:**
- To empower every Kenyan with access to quality products, no matter where they live.
- To use technology to bridge gaps in commerce, logistics, and customer service.
- To create a vibrant, trustworthy online marketplace that supports local businesses and delights customers.

**Their Story:**
Starting with just a laptop and a dream in the heart of Nairobi's Central Business District (CBD), Eric and Steve built Flowtechs from the ground up. Their youthful energy, coding skills, and relentless drive have made Flowtechs one of Kenya's most promising e-commerce startups.

**Message from the Founders:**
*"We're not just building a business—we're building a community and a movement. We believe in the power of technology to change lives, and we're excited to have you join us on this journey!"*

**Ready to experience the future of shopping?** Let's get started! 🛍️🚀`,
