EXACT CHANGES NEEDED FOR SWAHILI SUPPORT:

1. FIND THIS SECTION (around line 554-562):
```tsx
// Handle Kiswahili greetings
if (['sasa', 'mambo', 'uko aje', 'niaje', 'vipi'].includes(message)) {
  return {
    id: Date.now(),
    text: "Sasa! 😊 I see you're speaking Swahili! That's awesome! While I'm still learning and not yet fluent, I hope to chat with you in Swahili soon. For now, how can I help you in English? 🇰🇪",
